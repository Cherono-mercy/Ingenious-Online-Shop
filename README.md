# Ingenious-Online-Shop
#### Phase-1 Individual Project
## **By Cherono Mercy 17/10/2023**
#### Project Description
For this challenge, I was working on Ingenious, an online shopping app. 
I was using an open-source API: https://fakestoreapi.com/products to build out the front end.
    
#### Core Deliverables
As a user,
1. I can see a list of all the store products and display their prices and descriptions.
I needed to make a GET request to the GET/products endpoint to retrieve the character data.
2. Click on the "Add to Cart" button to start shopping by adding items to the cart.
Note, that I should be displaying the details of all items added to the cart.
I was using information from my first request to get the item's details to the cart.
3. In the cart, I should be able to add the quantity for each item.

   ## Project Requirements.
1. Your app must be an HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap or Tailwind frontend that accesses data from a public API.
 All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

2. Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3. Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

4. Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments.
These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

5. Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
